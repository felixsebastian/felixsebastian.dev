            author="Gene Kim et al."
            year="2016"
            comments="This book is so hard to get through, but shines a light on the DevOps revolution that took place over the past 20 years which is good for those who werenâ€™t around to experience it. I think DevOps practices are great but Gene Kim et al. do make it sound a bit dogmatic."

            author="Martin Kleppmann"
            year="2017"
            comments="This book is gold dust, I read it 3 times. It contains a lot of extreme pessimism (this thing can fall over in many terrifying ways) which is helpful for thinking about other areas of software development not covered by this book."
          />
          <BookPost
            title="Building Microservices"
            author="Sam Newman"
            year="2014"
            comments="This is such an important book for anyone developing web apps and thinking about microservices. It's pretty basic and easy to understand, and a good prelude to more in depth books like Designing Data Intensive Applications."

            author="John Ousterhout"
            year="2018"
            comments="This book was good but many chapters seemed a bit empty to me. I did find a few great (simple) ideas such as 'deep' abstractons and optimising for the common-case."

            year="1999"
            comments="Some excellent general advice in this book around basic things like honest communication and version control. Some of it seemed a bit outdated. Some of it just seemed like random opinions deemed to be the 'most pragmatic' way."

            author="Vaughn Vernon"
            year="2016"
            comments="A good introduction to DDD concepts, which are cool but much more relevant for enterprises where domain experts are the norm."

            author="Robert C. Martin"

            author="Robert C. Martin"
            year="2008"
            comments="Most of the advice in this book is either obvious enough or already widely adopted, such that most experienced coders would be doing it anyway. Still, it's good to have your habits validated by an industry legend and get a deeper understanding of the reasoning behind it."
