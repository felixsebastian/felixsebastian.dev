            year="2003"
            comments="Evans' idea of ubiquitous language seems like a formalisation of what's normally left to developers intuition and common sense. While this might be useful in some high stakes settings where domain experts are available, and has led to the discovery of other important concepts, my feeling is that it's probably unhelpful for most projects. I love how clearly Evans writes and still got a lot out of the book."

I feel slightly validated. Maybe a lot of it is common sense, but it's nice to have it all in one document that can be the basis of coding standards."
